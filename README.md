Real-Time Chat Application:


I developed a full-stack Real-Time Chat Application using React.js and Firebase, designed with a responsive interface for seamless mobile and desktop use. This application enables users to create personal accounts, update their profiles, engage in real-time conversations, and share images with friends.

Key Features:

  User Authentication: Implemented secure user authentication using Firebase Authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely.
  
  Profile Management: Users can update their profiles, including changing their profile pictures and personal information.
  
  Real-Time Messaging: Integrated Firebase Firestore to handle real-time storage and retrieval of messages, ensuring instant message delivery between users.
  
  Image Sharing: Users can send and receive images in chat conversations, with files stored and managed securely using Firebase Storage.
  
  Responsive Design: The user interface was designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
  
Technologies Used:

  Frontend: React.js
  
  Backend & Authentication: Firebase Authentication, Firebase Firestore
  
  Security: JWT (JSON Web Tokens), Bcrypt for password hashing
  
  HTTP Requests: Axios for handling API requests
  
  Image Storage: Firebase Storage
  
This project showcases my ability to build a secure, scalable, and interactive web application using modern frontend and backend technologies.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
